        <p><span class="first-character sc">H</span>i! My name is Arnav Govil. During my free time, I like to work on various coding projects, find and cook yummy recipes, and play video games. Among the three, I am most passionate about coding. It helps me improve my problem-solving skills, cultivate creativity, and explore innovative solutions to intricate problems.</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">I began coding when I was about eight years old when I joined a robotics club. I continued in the club until I was about ten years old, when I decided it began getting too confusing, and I had learned most of what I wanted to know from the club. After taking a year-long break from coding, quarantine occurred, and out of boredom, I began picking it up again from old Python (a coding language) projects I previously made, self-teaching myself by trying to reverse-engineer what I had coded. As quarantine continued, I had to continue school online, which allowed me plenty of time to finish my schoolwork and code more on the projects I was working on. Eventually, when I felt I had worked on enough of Python, I learned other programming languages and software such as Java, C#, Unity, Arduino, and now HTML and CSS to code this website!

      <h2>Skills of a Good Leader</h2>

    <div class="block">
      <h5><span class="first-characterLe ny">G</span>ood leaders possess many essential skills. In this section, I will explore the five key leadership skills that contribute to crafting an effective leader.
      </h5>
      <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
      <h4 class="margin-top-10">1. Communication</h4>
      <p>Clear communication is crucial to get ideas flowing and actions properly executed. A leader must be able to have this skill to make sure everyone understands what’s happening. Strong communication also builds trust, a major element every team should strive to have.</p>
      <h4 class="margin-top-10">2. Integrity</h4>
      <p>Integrity means encompassing honesty, transparency, and accountability for your actions, forming trust and dynamic collaboration. A leader needs to have this skill as it not only fosters a sense of reliability but inspires others to uphold similar values, nurturing a healthy environment for growth and respect.</p>
      <h4 class="margin-top-10">3. Motivation</h4>
      <p>You can’t lead a team that isn’t motivated to succeed. Motivation is a beneficial skill leaders should have as it pushes everyone to do their best, making everything more fun and everyone more engaged.</p>
      <h4 class="margin-top-10">4. Problem-Solving</h4>
      <p>Problems and obstacles can commonly occur within group work. A leader needs to know how to effectively and efficiently navigate through those obstacles while utilizing the team's efforts to overcome them. Fundamentally, this allows the team to focus on getting the most done, increasing their chances of overall success.</p>
      <h4 class="margin-top-10">5. Adaptation</h4>
      <p>A critical skill every leader should have is adapting to different situations. This skill enables leaders to identify opportunities and smoothly execute ideas. By embracing adaptability, leaders can navigate dynamic environments with efficiency, allowing change to take part in its natural course.</p>

The widespread love for UGG extended to Europe in the mid-2000's along with the stylish casual movement and demand for premium casual fashion. UGG boots and shoes were now seen walking the streets of London, Paris and Amsterdam with regularity.
